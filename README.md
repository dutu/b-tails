# What is B-Tails?

**No need to trust any computer. Leave no trace.**

You can temporarily turn the computer into a secure machine. You can also stay safe while using the computer of somebody else.

* Access your encrypted data and store data encrypted on the USB drive
* Browse the web securely and avoiding surveillance
* Use a selection of applications to work on sensitive documents and communicate securely
* Leave no trace on the computer

# B-Tails overview

With this guide you setup a USB memory stick, so you can use it as a bootable USB memory drive.

In addition, 3 partitions are created, two encrypted and one unencrypted, where personal data can be stored.

The data stored on these partitions can be accessed on a computer running any operating system, and, of course, when a computer is booted from the USB memory stick.

Bootable USB memory drive uses Tails. To find out more about Tails, goto [official Tails homepage](https://tails.boum.org).
