# This script generates a menu item, represented by a .desktop file, for a specific Flatpak application, the Id of which is passed as a parameter.
# If a custom .desktop file is available in the application's persistent directory, it is used as the source for the menu item.
# If this custom file does not exist, the script defaults to using the .desktop file from the Flatpak application's own directory.
# A copy of the source .desktop file is placed in the persistent dotfile directory, and a corresponding symbolic link is created in the local directory.
